Slideshow Presentation:

Your app should:
* Have a working front-end and back-end
* Use a single-page app framework for the front-end or native framework (iOS, Android)
* Persist data on the back-end
	* Could be PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mongo, Redis, etc.
* Look decent - either using custom CSS or a CSS Framework
* Use some significant technology that was not covered in the program. Examples include:
	* Using a different Front End Framework from the one you learned originally
	* Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
	* Making a desktop app with Electron/React Native Desktop etc.
	* Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
	* Using Rails, Spring, Java, or some other backend framework for building APIs
	* A complex API integration: Twilio, Sockets.io, etc
* Be deployed and ready to demo by the provided deadline
